# ACP Controlled Frontend Editor

This project is configured for controlled frontend refinement using ACP (Agent Client Protocol).

## About ACP

ACP is integrated directly into the DreamPilot project creation workflow (Phase 9).
It provides safe, validated frontend editing with the following protections:

### Safety Features
- ✅ Path validation (whitelist `frontend/src/` only)
- ✅ Forbidden paths (backend, components/ui/ protected)
- ✅ File limit (max 12 new files per execution)
- ✅ Snapshot system (backup before modifications)
- ✅ Automatic rollback (restore on validation or build failure)
- ✅ Build gate (npm run build must succeed for code changes)
- ✅ Hash-based filesystem diffing (accurate change detection)
- ✅ AI edit scope limiting (reduces timeouts)
- ✅ Verification build (always runs, even with no changes)
- ✅ AI duration tracking (optimizes prompts)

### Project Status
- **Project Name:** VPS Monitor
- **Project ID:** 1767
- **Template:** blank
- **Phase 9 Completed:** 2026-07-19T18:32:51.226404

- **Build Status:** N/A


### Technical Details
-ACP runs as Phase 9 of the infrastructure provisioning workflow
- Uses direct module import (no HTTP API required)
- Validates all paths before applying any changes
- Creates snapshots automatically before modifications
- Runs `npm install` and `npm run build` after code changes
- Automatically rolls back on validation or build failure
- Logs all mutations in `.acp_mutation_log.json`
- Note: ACP_README.md is documentation only and does not go through build validation

---
Phase 9 is complete! ACP is integrated as the final step of project creation.
